Version 1.10 (2012-05-27)
- Added a new theme! MediterraneanDark for those who love dark themes ;)
Note:
Temporarily MediterraneanDark maintain the GTK2 of MediterraneanNight, maybe it's good or bad, but for now is the only way I find to use reasonably Chrome and Firefox.
(If you prefer, you can copy the folder GTK2 of MediterraneanLight in MediterraneanDark)

- Fixed Color of some labels in rare circumstances 
- GTK2: Added option to enable or disable the use of the images .svg in checkbox/radiobuttons 
  This may solve the problem that some distros do not show checkbox/radiobuttons (See readme.txt)
